#### Summary

This is my final General Assembly project, I came up with the idea of building this back during our second project week when I built the jokes Generator but was advised that we would be learning better Technologies and frameworks later in the course that would be more suited to this project, hence this being my first React project. I'm glad I waited because this project requried such a framework to produce the result I have acheived.

The aim of this project was to build a budget planner to replicate the functionality of a budget planner I have used in the past, which can be found here [Moneysmart](https://moneysmart.gov.au/budgeting/budget-planner).
It wasn't until a meeting with a contact on the second day who advised me that often developers are tasked to replicate something pixel for pixel.
So that became my approach appart from other features on the official app my version is almost identical in terms of UX design and functionality, I think my accordian is smoother tho.

#### Goals

When I set out on this project I had sub categories and the form autosave feature in my backlog of things to do, I did not think I would get either of these done. While the subcatergories required a tonne of code and took a good while of solid typing I did manage to get this done in-time for presentation, the autosave feature is to be revisited.

#### What I have learned

I plan to get good at React so I will be focusing more on building other projects with this framework, I now have some fundamental knowledge and my logical thought process is improving.
I have come to understand many other things outside of the React framework much better as a result of this project.
