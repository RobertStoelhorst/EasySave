#### Summary

This is my final General Assembly project, I came up with the idea of building this back during our second project week when I built the jokes Generator but was advised that we would be learning better Technologies and frameworks later in the course that would be more suited to this project, hence this being my first React project.

The aim of this project was to build a budget planner to replicate the functionality of a budget planner I have used in the past, which can be found here [Moneysmart](https://moneysmart.gov.au/budgeting/budget-planner).
It wasn't until a meeting with a contact on the second day who advised me that often developers are tasked to replicate something pixel for pixel.
So that, along with basic functionality was the intended outcome.

Minus the caching and local browser storage feature on the official tool, my version is almost identical in terms of UX design and functionality, I think my accordion is smoother tho.

#### What I have learned

This project is a great example of why state management is a really valuable concept to dive into. Tho currently this project is reactive and smooth, As a developer and as a web app, there are far better ways and tools to handle state management than I have in this case.
